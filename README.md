Anonymized version of a network traffic comparison tool, developed for the BC Government (CITZ). Intended to find discrepancies in traffic through a given device, as reported by the APIs of multiple network monitoring systems.

Some key elements have been omitted or anonymized for network security reasons, so none of this will run. I also had to build some API wrappers, which are not included. If you're reading this, please excuse the mess!
